            The existing Texas Gun Law platform is cognitively complex, distracting, and overbearing. By shifting away the focus away from the visual UI and I wanted to build awareness towards educating the Texas community on gun law and safety.

          <p class="project-description">
            Without a user-friendly website, users are less likely to indulge in the process of online shopping. This process can often be the reason to why business’ online MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) is lower in comparison to in-store MRR. Also, some users tend to feel time-wasted when they have to search for hours to find a product that suits their needs. Our mission was to create a website that encourages for clienteles’ to have an overall enjoyable  online-shopping experience by redesigning and website and building a stronger online presence "
